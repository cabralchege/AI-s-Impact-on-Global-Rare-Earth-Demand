# AI’s Impact on Global Rare Earth Demand

## Overview
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is driving an unprecedented demand for advanced hardware from GPUs to quantum processors. These devices rely on *rare earth elements such as **Neodymium**, **Terbium**, and **Dysprosium**.  
This project explores how **AI expansion**, reflected in global patent filings, hardware production, and investments, correlates with **rising REE demand and price volatility**.

By integrating **Python**, **SQL/BigQuery (for querying large datasets)**, and **Tableau (for visualization)**, this project quantifies and visualizes the emerging relationship between AI innovation and global REE markets.

## Problem Statement
While AI development accelerates, policymakers and investors lack *quantitative evidence* linking AI’s growth to rising demand for rare earth elements.  
Understanding this connection is critical for planning sustainable mineral sourcing, avoiding shortages, and stabilizing tech hardware supply chains.

## Objectives
1. **Quantify** the relationship between AI hardware investments (GPUs, semiconductors) and demand for key REEs.  
2. **Correlate** REE price trends with AI patent filings and semiconductor output growth.  
3. **Visualize** future REE demand under multiple AI adoption scenarios (e.g., moderate, high, and extreme).  
4. **Highlight** countries driving AI-related REE consumption.  
5. **Identify** potential material risks and supply bottlenecks for future AI technologies.
